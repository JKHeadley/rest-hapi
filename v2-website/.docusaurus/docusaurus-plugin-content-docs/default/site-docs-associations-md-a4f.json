  "description": "The rest-hapi framework supports model associations that mimic associations in a relational database.  This includes one-one, one-many, many-one, and many-many relationships.  Associations are created by adding the relevant schema fields and populating the `associations object within routeOptions.  Associations exists as references to a document's _id` field, and can be populated to return the associated object.  See Querying for more details on how to populate associations.",
