When the config.enableSoftDelete property is set to `true, documents will gain an isDeleted property when they are created that will be set to false.  Whenever that document is deleted (via a rest-hapi endpoint or method), the document will remain in the collection, its isDeleted property will be set to true, and the deletedAt and deletedBy` properties (if enabled) will be populated.",
