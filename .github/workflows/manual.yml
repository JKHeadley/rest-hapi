# This is a basic workflow that is manually triggered

# HOW TO USE
# One of the challenges with testing NEW github workflows is that you can't trigger them without first
# having the workflow existing in the main branch of the repo.
# Once that workflow is there, you can update the workflow on any branch, and run that branch's version
# of the workflow. So to use this and test a manually triggered workflow:
# 1. Check out a new branch and modify this file
# 2. Push your branch, then in your browser, navigate to the Github workflow
# 3. Click on "Manual workflow" and trigger it, specifying your branch.

name: Manual workflow

# Controls when the action will run. Workflow runs when manually triggered using the UI
# or API.
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    # Inputs the workflow accepts.
    inputs:
      name:
        # Friendly description to be shown in the UI instead of 'name'
        description: 'Person to greet'
        # Default value if no value is explicitly provided
        default: 'World'
        # Input has to be provided for the workflow to run
        required: true

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job that can be modified on a branch to test behaviors
  scratch-job:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Send greeting
      run: echo "Hello ${{ github.event.inputs.name }}"
    - name: Exit if failed match
      run:  |
        echo $MATCH;
        echo ${#MATCH};
        if [[ -z "$MATCH" ]]; then
            echo "this shouldn't print"
        fi
      env:
        MATCH: "asdf123"
