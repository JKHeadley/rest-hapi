# This is a basic workflow that is manually triggered

# HOW TO USE
# One of the challenges with testing NEW github workflows is that you can't trigger them without first
# having the workflow existing in the main branch of the repo.
# Once that workflow is there, you can update the workflow on any branch, and run that branch's version
# of the workflow. So to use this and test a manually triggered workflow:
# 1. Check out a new branch and modify this file
# 2. Push your branch, then in your browser, navigate to the Github workflow
# 3. Click on "Manual workflow" and trigger it, specifying your branch.

# Controls when the action will run. Workflow runs when manually triggered using the UI
# or API.

    # Inputs the workflow accepts.
    inputs:
      name:
        # Friendly description to be shown in the UI instead of 'name'
        description: 'Person to greet'
        # Default value if no value is explicitly provided
        default: 'World'
        # Input has to be provided for the workflow to run
        required: true

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
